    <!--About Section-->
      <h3><i>Fuck is this?</i></h3>
      <p>Its nearly 10 years since nightvision was first created. I thought that we should do something for 10 years, and this is that.
        The plan is to create an episode<i>(or episodes depending on how this goes)</i> of nightvision with actual production values.
        Still probably wont be scripted, but it will at least have better camera work, No more coming up with plans during the episode
        and whispering like we think the camera wont hear us and no more talking over each other, and most of all no more fights or
        stuttering or any of that shit. We will make a basic plan and go from there and everyone just goes with whatever happens.
        This time Ill actually let other people touch the fucking camera.
      </p>

    <!--What Happened to old episodes Section-->
      <h3><i>You still got all those old episodes?</i></h3>
      <p>Im in the process of editing and uploading episodes which may take a while because my computers fucked so render times and
         transcoding times are really long on my laptop :/ Currently I just rendered Episode4(which may have brought you here idk)
         and I have the masters for about 3 episodes, one of which I need to recut and the other two would lose too much quality in
        re slicing them so Im just going to leave them as they were. I also have source files for 3 or 4 episodes which Im transcoding
        to mp4 files so I can edit them. Not everyone is in all them(notably, "Captain Moo Moo" is not in the first 2 or 3 episodes and
        "Wiffy G"("Pizza Pony") is only in 2 or 3 episodes. Some episodes are complete spinoffs(they only contain "fudgepants" and some
        people that arent main members of the cast). A large amount of the source files are complete SHITE quality so rip like 4 episodes
        I guess :( By shit quality I mean that theyve got either a fuckload of noise or a fuckload of artifacting, if we are including 
        shit production quality then all the ones I held the camera for or organised are shit quality aswell (basically all of them) in
        future (if I can even bring everyone back) hopefully there will be a lot more value in the videos, and less degradation in between
        episodes as I have a 4K camera now(my phone :p) Jesus christ I just realised how much I fucking rambled on here, Well Ill link you
        to episode 4 <a href="https://youtu.be/jXCZyFtvYXY"><i><b>here,</b></i></a> and Ill make a page for all the videos when I have
        time or most likely when I have a few videos uploaded. If you want a specific video ask me to upload it because I couldnt be fucked
        uploading it otherwise. /endramble</p>

      <!--Return of members section-->
      <h3><i>How do I know who has come back?</i></h3>
      <p>Well obviously there is me(S0lr_, Fudgepants, The wierd kid that spends all his time editing old videos, etc) and Bob(if you forgot
        bob then get the fuck out :P) and I think CaptainSpiderPig <i>LMK if your back in CaptainSpiderPig</i> so now we just need
        CaptainMooMoo <i>If your reading this LMK if your back</i> and WiffyG or PizzaPony or whatever the fuck your name is now XD <i>Again,
        LMK if your back in</i> and then we can get started on an episode(We will decide what its about on discord)</p>
