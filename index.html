      <h3><i>Fuck is this?</i></h3>
      <p>Its nearly 10 years since nightvision was first created. I thought that we should do something for 10 years, and this is that.
        The plan is to create an episode<i>(or episodes depending on how this goes)</i> of nightvision with actual production values.
        Still probably wont be scripted, but it will at least have better camera work, No more coming up with plans during the episode
        and whispering like we think the camera wont hear us and no more talking over each other, and most of all no more fights or
        stuttering or any of that shit. We will make a basic plan and go from there and everyone just goes with whatever happens.
        This time Ill actually let other people touch the fucking camera.
      </p>
